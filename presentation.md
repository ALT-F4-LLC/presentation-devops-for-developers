# DevOps for Developers

An introduction to DevOps and its purpose in software development.

---

# Introduction

Let's begin our dive into DevOps by breaking it down.

---

# What Exists Today

## Poorly Defined

Because DevOps is a broad and somewhat abstract concept, it can be difficult for companies to define and implement in a concrete and consistent way.

---

# What Exists Today

## Culture Challenges

Additionally, because DevOps involves cultural shifts within an organization, it can be challenging for companies to adopt and integrate into their existing processes and ways of working.

---

# What Exists Today

## Suboptimal Solutions

Developers and IT professionals may not be working together as efficiently and effectively as possible, which can result in suboptimal solutions that do not meet the needs of the business or the end users.

---

# What Exists Today

## Missing Communication

A lack of clear communication and collaboration between these teams can lead to errors and other problems that can compromise the quality of the solutions being produced.

---

# Start from Scratch

- forget what you've `seen` about DevOps
- forget what you've `heard` about DevOps
- forget what you've `done` with DevOps

---

# Define Your DevOps

We need to define what DevOps means uniquely to us before we can properly harness its power for an organization.

---

# What DevOps IS

The goal of DevOps is to improve the speed and reliability of software releases by automating parts of the software development and deployment process, and by fostering a culture of collaboration and experimentation among teams.

---

# What DevOps IS NOT

DevOps is not a specific tool or technology. It is not a job title or a job description, and it is not a standalone practice that can be implemented in isolation.

---

# What DevOps IS NEVER

## Tools or Technologies!

---

# DevOps is a Philosophy

DevOps is a philosophy or mindset that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between software developers and IT operations teams.

---

# Three W's of Stradegy

## The three W's of strategy are:

Why - reasons and motivations behind the strategy.
What - goals and objectives that the strategy is intended to achieve.
Who - people who are benefiting from this.

Together, these three W's help to provide a clear understanding of the strategy and what it aims to accomplish.

---

# The Why, What & Who

- Why do we need DevOps?
- What do we accomplish with DevOps?
- Who do we help with DevOps?

---

# Standards vs. Rules

DevOps standards are guidelines or best practices that organizations can follow to implement standards successfully. These standards typically cover areas such as communication, collaboration, and automation, and can help organizations to improve their software development process and deliver better products to their customers.

---

# Automation Standards

Automating the software development and deployment process, using tools such as continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

---

# Planning Standards

Using agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, to increase collaboration and flexibility.

---

# Quality Standards

Implementing strict version control and configuration management processes to ensure that software is properly tested and deployed

---

# Communication Standards

Encouraging open communication and collaboration among all members of the development team, including developers, IT operations professionals, and business stakeholders.

---

# Improving Standards

Using metrics and data to track and improve the performance of the software development process.

---

# The Power of TDDs

## Technical Design Document

A technical design document (TDD) is a document that describes how a piece of software will be implemented and how it will work. It typically includes detailed information about the system's architecture, modules, interfaces, and data structures, as well as information about any external dependencies or required resources.

---

# The Power of TDDs

## Technical Design Document

A technical design document is used to guide the development of a software system, and can be used to communicate the technical aspects of the system to stakeholders and developers.

---

# The Power of TDDs

## Your First TDD

There is no standardized way to writing documentation. The best advice I’ve ever been given was focus only on the specific issue or problem.

Ask yourself what the problem IS and tell the story around that. Set proper boundaries if you need to and include an “out-of-scope” section when you discover items outside of the current issues problem resolution path.

---

# The Power of TDDs

## Your First TDD

Apply existing common practices to problem solving that the organization has agreed upon. In this case, we can use the "Three W's of Stradegy" to help solve our problem.

---

# The Power of TDDs

## Your First TDD

- What problem are we trying to solve? (you should always have this)
- What is the current process? (optional, though normally helpful)
- What are the requirements? (optional, can help with scope)
- How do we solve this problem? (you should always have this)
